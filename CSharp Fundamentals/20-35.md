# Ternary Operators
- Example: String x = Condition ==?== True output ==:== False Output
- Note : the True/False output must return something, can't be void
----
# Foreach Loop
- Better used for collections (arrays - sets - etc...)
- ![[Pasted image 20250107194616.png]]
----
# Do while loop vs while loop
- Do-while loop ->  will at least execute once
---
# Switch-Case statement
```
switch(selectedOption){
case "1" : 
case "2" :
case "3" :
default:
}

//case 1 and 2 will be the same
switch(selectedOption){
case "1" : 
case "2" :
some code
case "3" :
default:
}

```
- Notice that default can be placed in any place withing  the switch statement
----
# Methods
The difference between the following two methods is that
- The first one the reference to the array is "passed by value"
	- The reference to the array here can't be changed to point to another array because it's copied by value
- The second method, a reference to the reference to the array is passed (***pass by reference*** to the reference )
	- The reference itself can be changed to point to another array
```c#
Int changeArr (int[] numbers){}
Int changeArr (ref int[] numbers){} //when you want to change the reference itself inside the method, to point to another array
```
- Method naming -> starts with a verb
- Consider Single Responsibility Principle while writing your function
- **Any code written after ==return line== will not execute, you can even write a return line in a void function.**
	- ![[Pasted image 20250107214509.png]]
## Optional arguements
![[Pasted image 20250107214823.png]]
- You just add a default value to the arguement
- Optional arguements must be added to **==the end==** of arguements
## In case you have multiple optional arguements

-  you can pass the optional value to a certain arguement through the following while invoking the function (to skip optional parameters in the middle)
	- ![[Pasted image 20250107215355.png]]
	- You simply mention => the name of the arguement : the value of the arguement

# Comments
## Single line comment
`//`

## Multi-line comment

```

## Todo comments
```
// todo: dkjfklajsdfkljaskldfja
// todo: dkjfklajsdfkljaskldfja

```
Go to 'view' then 'task list', you will find all the lines that contain "todo" and where they are.
## XML documentation comments
### What it does
- This is used to document your methods, like the way when you use a .Net function like "WriteLine ()" for example, it shows you the parameters and the description of the method and also what it returns, we want to do that for the methods we write too for the other programmers to understand easily, or when you create a library and publish it on github.
### How to do it
- Just write 3 consecutive forward slashes  /// before your method
- Somethig like this should come up

# Training
Finding the biggest or smallest number in an array
- Notice that when initialize **the smallest number** you intialize with **int. MaxValue** and with **the biggest number** you initialize with the **MinValue.**
---
# Data Types (Value Types - Reference Types)

## Value Types
 - Stored in **the Stack**
## Reference Types (array - ==string (immutable)==)

```c#
int[] arr = {1,2,3};
```
- =={1,2,3}== Stored in **the heap**
- ==Arr== Stored in **the Stack**

[[Memory Leak]] can happen when you're dealing with strings that may blow up ur memory.

# Type casting
## Implicit Casting
![[Pasted image 20250110013253.png]]
- Can implicit cast **from smaller** data types **to bigger** ==ones only==
- Hence the last three lines of code have ==ERROR== 
## Explicit Casting
```c#
float x = 1.3f
int a = (int)x;
```
---
# String Formatting
```c#
String x = "Hello {0}, My Name is {1} ---- {0}"
xx = string.format(str,"Ahmed","Mohamed")
```
- Think  of "Ahmed" and "Mohamed " as array, all elements that come after "str" is like an array that is zero based indexed
- 
```c#
String x = "Hello {0}, My Name is {1,15} ---- {0,12}"
xx = string.format(str,"Ahmed","Mohamed")
```
- 15 and 12 here respresent the number of characters that it will always take regardless of the value that you will pass to it.
```c#
String x = "My salary is {0:c2}"
xx = string.format(str,"10000")
//the output will be $10,000.00 // c for currency and 2 is the number of zeros after the decimal point
```
```c#
String x = "My salary is {0:N2}"
xx = string.format(str,"10000")
//the output will be 10,000.00 // n for number and 2 is the number of zeros after the decimal point
```

Now we know about <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">String Interpolation</mark> and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">String Formatter</mark>

# String Split/Join
```c#
//Split
string[] arr = "I,love,Mohamed,so,much".Split(',');
//join
string x = string.Join(" ", arr);
```
## Substring (start index, length) Method


---

# String Builder
- String is **not mutable**
## Properties
Capacity
MaxCapacity
Length
## When to use it
- We use it when we do lots of editing on the text
- Large text corpus
## Code example
```c#
StringBuilder Text = new StringBuilder();
Text.Append("My name is Ahmed");
Text.Append("I love coding");
Text.Append(", coding loves me : )");
StringBuilder Text = new StringBuilder(4069); //here i mentioned the number of bytes to reserve in advance.

 // the idea behind it that it keeps stretching as long as I am appending to it.

# Compilation process

- ***Building*** : the project requires the compiler to work.
![[Pasted image 20250110035158.png]]

## Managed vs unmanaged languages
Managed languages like java - c# where the Source code is not directrly compiled to  machine code, It's compiled to intermediate code (byte code in Java)
## CLR Common Language Runtime
1.  JIT Just In Time Compilation OR jitter
	1. Responsible for the conversion from the Intermediate Language(IL) to Machine Code
	2. ONLY the IL that's actually needed and called/used is turned to machine code NOT everything
	3. JIT is responsible for the translation from the CIL (common intermediate language) to processor specified/targetted machine code
2.  CLS common language Specification
3.  CTS Common Type System
